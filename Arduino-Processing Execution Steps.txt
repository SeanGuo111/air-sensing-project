1. All of your code changes are made primarily from Arduino

2. From a clean slate, firstly you have to open Arduino (making sure Processing is closed). Make any edits to your code now if necessary. Then save and upload Arduino and close it.

3. Secondly, open Processing and run SyncArduinoClock.

4. To make any further edits, terminate Processing (no need to close app) and open Arduino back up again. Then do 2.
